GOAL
====

This repository holds the sources for my MD year project, entitled GosuBB.
My main goal here is to develop a Blood Bowl client, featuring a decent AI, using ruby.
If I would ever have the time to use Rubinius in order to get benefits from JIT, I will, but this
is cleary not a main priority as for now.
